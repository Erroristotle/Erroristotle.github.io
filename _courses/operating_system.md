In this course, we delve into the intricacies of how operating systems function, manage resources, and ensure security. The practical sessions include hands-on experiments with various operating systems.

The code is simple. Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
