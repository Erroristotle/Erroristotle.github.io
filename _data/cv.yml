  "research_interests": "I focus on the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on adversarial machine learning, the robustness of machine learning models, and the trustworthiness and interpretability of models in adversarial settings. I often use Python to build tools that help with these topics because I am comfortable with it and find it useful for security tasks.",

This tool was created to identify the sequence of logs and perform queries on Elasticsearch using various indices, addressing common issues faced by Network and Security Operation Centers (NOC and SOC). Subsequently, I developed the back-end of the application using Python Django and created APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for communication with other network modules.",
