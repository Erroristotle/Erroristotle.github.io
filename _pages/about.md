I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UNCC, focusing on the security of Large Language Models. My primary research focus is vulnerability detection, which I have explored across networks, software, and AI systems. I have worked extensively on adversarial machine learning and am now leveraging LLM agents for automated vulnerability detection and program repair.
\\
My work revolves around testing AI models and applying them to software engineering and cybersecurity tasks. I am deeply passionate about improving AI security by making models more robust, trustworthy, and interpretable in adversarial settings. My goal is to improve security measures using AI while ensuring AI itself remains secure.
\\
I love connecting with other tech enthusiasts and professionals. If you're interested in collaboration, have a challenging question related to my research, or are working on similar security challenges, feel free to reach out!

Mentorship and Support ðŸ’ª \\
I dedicate 2 hours each week to mentoring and supporting students pursuing a PhD at universities. Whether it's guidance on research, career development, or navigating life as a graduate student, I'm here to help. I especially encourage individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to connect with me via email or any platformâ€”your journey matters, and Iâ€™m here to support it.
