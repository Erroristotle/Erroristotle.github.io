I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UNCC, focusing on the security of Large Language Models. My research focuses on testing these models and applying them to software engineering and cybersecurity tasks. I am deeply passionate about enhancing AI security, with a particular emphasis on making AI models more robust, trustworthy, and understandable in adversarial settings across various contexts, including networks and software. I am enthusiastic about using AI to improve security measures and ensuring the safety of AI itself.
