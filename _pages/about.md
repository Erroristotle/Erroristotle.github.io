I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, advised by <a href="https://mpvieira.github.io/" style="color:blue;">Dr. Marco Vieira</a>. My research focuses on **using Large Language Models (LLMs) for software security**, with a particular emphasis on **vulnerability detection**, **automated program repair**, and **dataset development** to support these tasks.
\\
I am currently working on building high-quality, task-specific datasets that enable more effective training and evaluation of LLMs for software vulnerability detection and patch generation. My broader background spans **network security**, **software security**, and **adversarial machine learning**. I apply LLMs to key tasks in **software engineering and cybersecurity**, such as static code analysis, patch synthesis, and secure code generation.

\\
I love connecting with other tech enthusiasts and professionals. If you're interested in collaboration, have a challenging question related to my research, or are working on similar software and security challenges, feel free to reach out!

Mentorship and Support ðŸ’ª \\
I dedicate 2 hours each week to mentoring and supporting students pursuing a PhD at universities. Whether it's guidance on research, career development, or navigating life as a graduate student, I'm here to help. I especially encourage individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to connect with me via email or any platformâ€”your journey matters, and Iâ€™m here to support it.
